Program 3 - RPC

FILE ARCHIVE:

	Makefile (this Makefile can be used to make and make clean all Makefiles in the subdirectories)

	README

	submarine -->
		sub_client.c
		Makefile

	rpc_subd -->
		sub_server.c
		Makefile

	shared -->
		shared.h
		sub.h
		sub.x
		Makfile

	**NOTE** - if the Makefiles are called separately, the Makefile in shared must be called first so the appropriate files will be generated.

FEATURES:
	Play again -- after a win (or loss- see the next feature), a user has the opportunity to play again
	Stationary bomb -- at the start of the game, a bomb is placed in the grid.  If the user hits the bomb,
		then she loses the game.  However, if the submarine hits the bomb, then the user automatically
		wins (without ever finding the submarine).
