This directory contains one file, udpserver.c.  When compiled, the program runs as a UDP server, receiving and sending messages on the port that is passed as an argument from the command line.  Usage:  ./udpserver port
Clients can send messages to the server by using the server's ip address and port number.  The server, upon receiving a message, will reverse the order of the characters of the string and add a timestamp to the message before sending it back to the client.
The timestamp is calculated using the time function gettimeofday, which returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the UNIX epoch. From this value, the number of seconds that have elapsed since the day began is calculated using sSinceEpoch % (3600 * 24) (dividing instead of using % gives the days since the epoch). Following a pattern similar to this, hrs, minutes, and seconds were derived from the seconds since epoch. Microseconds is saved as a different data member of the structure passed into gettimeofday.  Finally, 4 hours was subtracted from the hour value to account for our time difference from UTC (which is what gettimeofday uses).
